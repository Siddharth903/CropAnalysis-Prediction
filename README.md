#Deploy Steps on Local Environment are as follows :-




Deploy branch has only the code required for deploying the app (rest of the code that was used for training the models, data preparation can be accessed on `master` branch)
- It is highly recommended to clone the deploy branch for running the project locally (the further steps apply only if you have the deploy branch cloned)
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n harvestify python=3.6.12
  conda activate harvestify
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- Open the localhost url provided after running `app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.
